You should see a meadow in a forest, with a single large flower in the middle of the stage. There's also a slider on the stage that will eventually control the number of flowers you see.

--- task ---

The flower is a little too large, so the first thing to do is resize it. Add these blocks to the flower sprite.

```blocks3
when flag clicked
set size to [5] %
```

You don't have to use this size, experiment with different `set size to`{:class="block3looks"} numbers until you have a flower size you like.

Click the green flag to see the new size of your flower.
